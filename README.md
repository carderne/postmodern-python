# postmodern-python
A very simple template for productive Python.

This template pulls together most of the advice and ideas from this blog post, which explains the choices in more detail:

[Beyond Hypermodern: Python is easy now](https://rdrn.me/postmodern-python/)

It includes the following bits:
- Rye for Python, virtual env, dependency management and script running
- Ruff for formatting and linting (replaces isort, flake, isort etc)
- Pyright for type checking (set to strict mode, but do what makes you happy)
- Pytest for tests
- A Github Actions workflows for formatting/linting/checking/testing PRs/merges
- Another for releasing to PyPI
- A basic Dockerfile for running in a container
- Some basic Python snippets to get you started
- The rest of this README!

## ðŸ¤” How to use this template
1. Hit the green `Use this template` button up on the right next to the stars
2. Give your new repository a name and then clone it to your dev environment.
3. Rename it:
```bash
./rename.sh your-cool-new-name
```
4. Run `rye sync`
5. Have a look at the stuff below here, try out some commands and edit this README as you like!

## ðŸ’¾ Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:carderne/postmodern-python.git
cd postmodern-python
pip install -e .
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
From the command line:
```bash
python -m postmodern  # thanks to __main__.py

# or
postmodern  # thanks to pyproject.toml, project.scripts
```

From Python:
```python
from postmodern import hello
hello()
```

## ðŸ§± Development
Using [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) for development (installation instructions at the link).

Install Python and dependencies:
```bash
rye sync
```

Format, lint, typecheck etc:
```bash
rye run fmt
        lint
        check
        test
        all   # runs all the above sequentially
```

## ðŸ¦º CI/CD
This has Github Actions setup for Pull Requests and for Release to PyPI.
1. The [pr.yml](.github/workflows/pr.yml) workflow will run on any new Pull Request.
Change some code, open a PR and wait for teh green tick!

2. The [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) is for releasing packages to PyPI.
It is currently set up to to run only when you create a new [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
But you can change that!

### Docker
It also has a Dockerfile that you can try out as follows:
1. Build it
```bash
docker build --tag postmdoern-image .
```

2. Run it
```bash
docker run --rm -it postmodern-image

# output
# I dunno, start the server or something?
```
